API resources are templates 
where you define how you want the JSON data to be returned back to the user
when they send an API request.

ex. php artisan make:resource RESOURCE_NAME(PetitionResource)
This will create API resource for a single Petition

When we want to return more than one resource, more than one Petition 
we need to create a resource collection.
php artisan make:resource PetitionCollection
___________________________________________________________________________________

php artisan make:model Petition -mfs (create also migration, factory and seeder)
php artisan make:controller PetitionController --api --model=Petition
php artisan make:resource PetitionResource
php artisan make:resource PetitionCollection
___________________________________________________________________________________

php artisan db:seed --class=PetitionSeeder
!!! with big applications you would like to run seeders individually

___________________________________________________________________________________

// JUST FOR REFERENCE
Route::get('/petitions', [PetitionController::class, 'index']);
Route::post('/petitions', [PetitionController::class, 'index']);

Route::resource('/petitions', PetitionController::class)->only(['index', 'store']);

Route::apiResource('petitions', PetitionController::class);

API resources - way to structure JSON data

API resources 
  -are templates that define the structure of JSON data returned in the response.
  -allow us to transform the data we send to the user
  example: hide some fields or add computed field

HOW IT WORK
When user request some data, 
we get the data from database,
pass it thrue resource template,
and that user get
____________________________________________________________________________________

MassAsignments

-every time create method is used it check for mass assignment.
-two ways to deal with:
   - set fillable or guarded property. Not both
   - fillable (list of fields we can give permision to go in database). USE when you have small number of fields.
   - guarded (list of fields that can not be mass assignment, go in database)
_____________________________________________________________________________________

PUT - replace everything or create new if it doesn't exist
PATCH - replace only some fields

POSTMAN - free API testing tool
-test, develop and document

What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
The application can be any software that performs a specific task 
and the interface is a point where two applications communicate.

One application acts as a client and the other acts as a server. 
A client asks for some resource, say for example a photo, and the server sends that photo to the client.

How Do APIs Work?
Computers follow a protocol to communicate with each other. 
A protocol is nothing but a set of rules that computers follow to communicate.

Communications that take place over the HTTP protocol are also known as the request-response cycle 
because this is exactly how the protocol works. 
The client sends a request to the server and the server responds to the client regarding that request.

The header includes information like the format our computer expects to get and accept – 
 like language meaning, the language of the device, our operating system, and so on. 
The body includes the data we need to send to the server, the nature keyword for example.

Types of APIs :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
web APIs that use the HTTP protocol.
Other types include internal APIs that are hidden from external users and that are used within a company only
There are also open APIs that are available to be used by anyone for free (like the open weather map API)
